Description: Functionality for manipulating values of associative
  maps.  The package is designed to be used with the 'mvp' class of
  packages that use the STL map class: its purpose is to trap
  plausible idiom that is ill-defined (implementation-specific) and
  return an informative error, rather than returning a possibly
  incorrect result.  To cite the package in publications please use
  Hankin (2022) <doi:10.48550/ARXIV.2210.03856>.
