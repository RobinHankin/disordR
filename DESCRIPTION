Description: Functionality for manipulating values (or keys) of
  associative maps.  One can manipulate elements of a vector but
  without reference to their location in the vector.  Is is as though
  one is only allowed to access or modify a vector via a python list
  comprehension.  The idea is to prevent "illegal" operations on
  values (or keys) of associative maps, whose order is undefined or at
  best implementation-specific.  The package is needed for development
  versions of 'mvp', 'hyper2', 'spray', 'clifford', and 'freealg'.
