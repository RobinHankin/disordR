Description: Functionality for manipulating values of associative
  maps.  Ordinary R vectors are unsuitable for working with values of
  associative maps because elements of an R vector may be accessed by
  reference to their location in the vector, but associative maps are
  stored in arbitrary order.  However, when associating keys with
  values one needs both parts to be in 1-1 correspondence, so one
  cannot dispense with the order entirely.  The 'disordR' package
  includes a single S4 class, disord.  This class allows one to
  perform only those operations appropriate for manipulating values of
  associative maps and prevents any other operation (such as accessing
  an element at a particular location).  A useful heuristic is that
  one is only allowed to access or modify a disord object using a
  python list comprehension.  The idea is to prevent ill-defined
  operations on values (or keys) of associative maps, whose order is
  undefined or at best implementation-specific, while allowing and
  facilitating sensible operations.
