The files here are intended to be processed by arXiv to create a nice
pdf document.  
File disordR_arxiv.tex is held under version control but can (in
principle) be generated by

R CMD Sweave disordR_arxiv.Rnw

Note that this intentionally generates a disordR discipline error from
one of the chunks, but the error is trapped by try().

It is possible to process disordR_arxiv.tex with latex locally on a
linux machine but frankly arXiv use a shed-load of weird latex
configuration settings that are difficult to reproduce.  I get some
warning about shorttitle which I do not understand.  If you ignore
this warning then a reasonably nice PDF document is produced.

For latex to work, a few standard auxiliary files must be available to
LaTeX: orcid.pdf, disordR.png, arxiv.sty.
