# Print method for disord objects

Show methods for disords

## Usage

``` r
# S4 method for class 'disord'
show(x)
disord_show(x)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  Object of class disord

## Details

The print method simply prints the object's hash and its elements,
together with a reminder that the elements are listed in an
implementation-specific order. Function `disord_show()` is a helper
function, not really intended for the end-user.
