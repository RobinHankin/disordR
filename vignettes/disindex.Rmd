```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Experimental `S4` class `disindex` allows extraction methods,
including list extraction, to operate with the output of `which()`.
Consider the following R session:

```{r}
library("disordR")
(d <- disord(c(4,6,1,2,3,4,5,1)))
ind <- which(d>4)
```

Above, object `ind` points to those elements of `d` which exceed 4.  Thus:

```{r}
d
d[ind]
d[ind] <- 99
d
```

However, we cannot assert that `ind` is elements 2 and 7 of `d`, for
the elements of `d` are stored in an implementation-specific order.
If we examine `ind` directly, we see:

```{r}
ind
```

which correctly says that the elements of `ind` are
implementation-specific.  However, the main application of `disindex`
objects is for list extraction.

```{r}
d <- disord(c(4,1,6,2))
dl <- sapply(d,function(x){seq(from=5,to=x)})
dl
```

Suppose I wish to extract from object `dl` just the element with the
longest length.  Noting that this would be a `disord`-compliant
question, we would use:

```{r}
howlong <- unlist(lapply(dl,length))
longest <- which(howlong == max(howlong))
dl[[longest]]
```
